          If this is your first time using Django, you’ll have to take care of
          some initial setup. Namely, you’ll need to auto-generate some code
          that establishes a Django project – a collection of settings for an
          instance of Django, including database configuration, Django-specific
          options and application-specific settings.
        </p>

        <p>
          From the command line, <strong>cd</strong> into a directory where
          you’d like to store your code, then run the following command:
        </p>

        <div class="shell"><code>$ django-admin startproject mysite</code></div>
        <p>
          This will create a <strong>mysite</strong> directory in your current
          directory. If it didn’t work, see
          <a
            href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/faq/troubleshooting/#troubleshooting-django-admin"
            target="_blank"
            >Problems running django-admin</a
          >.
        </p>

            <h3>Note</h3>
            <p>
              You’ll need to avoid naming projects after built-in Python or
              Django components. In particular, this means you should avoid
              using names like <strong>django</strong> (which will conflict with
              Django itself) or <strong>test</strong> (which conflicts with a
              built-in Python package).
            </p>

            <h3>Where should this code live?</h3>
            <p>
              If your background is in plain old PHP (with no use of modern
              frameworks), you’re probably used to putting code under the Web
              server’s document root (in a place such as
              <strong>/var/www</strong>). With Django, you don’t do that. It’s
              not a good idea to put any of this Python code within your Web
              server’s document root, because it risks the possibility that
              people may be able to view your code over the Web. That’s not good
              for security.
            </p>

            <p>
              Put your code in some directory <strong>outside</strong> of the
              document root, such as <strong>/home/mycode</strong>.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>Let’s look at what <strong>startproject</strong> created:</p>

        <div class="shell">
          <!-- prettier-ignore -->
          <code>
            <pre>

        __init__.py
        settings.py
        urls.py
        asgi.py
        wsgi.py
            </pre>
          </code>
        </div>

        <p>These files are:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            The outer <strong>mysite/</strong> root directory is a container for
            your project. Its name doesn’t matter to Django; you can rename it
            to anything you like.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>manage.py</strong>: A command-line utility that lets you
            interact with this Django project in various ways. You can read all
            the details about <strong>manage.py</strong> in
            <a href="#">django-admin</a> and <a href="#">manage.py</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            The inner <strong>mysite/</strong> directory is the actual Python
            package for your project. Its name is the Python package name you’ll
            need to use to import anything inside it (e.g.
            <strong>mysite.urls</strong>).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>mysite/__init__.py</strong>: An empty file that tells Python
            that this directory should be considered a Python package. If you’re
            a Python beginner, read <a href="#">more about packages</a> in the
            official Python docs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>mysite/settings.py</strong>: Settings/configuration for this
            Django project. <a href="#">Django settings</a> will tell you all
            about how settings work.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>mysite/urls.py</strong>: The URL declarations for this
            Django project; a “table of contents” of your Django-powered site.
            You can read more about URLs in <a href="#">URL dispatcher</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>mysite/asgi.py</strong>: An entry-point for ASGI-compatible
            web servers to serve your project. See
            <a href="#">How to deploy with ASGI</a> for more details.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>mysite/wsgi.py</strong>: An entry-point for WSGI-compatible
            web servers to serve your project. See
            <a href="#">How to deploy with WSGI</a> for more details.

          Let’s verify your Django project works. Change into the outer mysite
          directory, if you haven’t already, and run the following commands:
        </p>

        <div class="shell"><code>$ python manage.py runserver</code></div>

        <p>You’ll see the following output on the command line:</p>

        <p>
          You’ve started the Django development server, a lightweight Web server
          written purely in Python. We’ve included this with Django so you can
          develop things rapidly, without having to deal with configuring a
          production server – such as Apache – until you’re ready for
          production.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now’s a good time to note: <strong>don’t</strong> use this server in
          anything resembling a production environment. It’s intended only for
          use while developing. (We’re in the business of making Web frameworks,
          not Web servers.)
        </p>

        <p>
          Now that the server’s running, visit
          <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/">http://127.0.0.1:8000/</a> with your
          Web browser. You’ll see a “Congratulations!” page, with a rocket
          taking off. It worked!

        <header><h2>Creating the Polls app</h2></header>

        <p>
          Now that your environment – a “project” – is set up, you’re set to
          start doing work.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each application you write in Django consists of a Python package that
          follows a certain convention. Django comes with a utility that
          automatically generates the basic directory structure of an app, so
          you can focus on writing code rather than creating directories.
        </p>

            <h3>Projects vs. apps</h3>
            <p>
              What’s the difference between a project and an app? An app is a
              Web application that does something – e.g., a Weblog system, a
              database of public records or a small poll app. A project is a
              collection of configuration and apps for a particular website. A
              project can contain multiple apps. An app can be in multiple
              projects.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>
          Your apps can live anywhere on your <a href="#">Python path</a>. In
          this tutorial, we’ll create our poll app in the same directory as your
          manage.py file so that it can be imported as its own top-level module,
          rather than a submodule of mysite.
        </p>

        <p>
          To create your app, make sure you’re in the same directory as
          <strong>manage.py</strong> and type this command:
        </p>

        <div class="shell"><code>$ python manage.py startapp polls</code></div>

      <section class="main-section" id="Write_your_first_view">
        <header><h2>Write your first view</h2></header>

        <p>
          Let’s write the first view. Open the file
          <strong>polls/views.py</strong> and put the following Python code in
          it:
        </p>

        <div class="python-code-container">
          <div class="file-path">polls/views.py</div>
